Web demo code for [Primitive Haxe](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/primitive-haxe/), a cross-platform Haxe library for recreating images with geometric primitives. Try the demo live in your browser [here](http://tw1ddle.github.io/primitive-haxe-web-demo/).

## Features
* Geometrize your own images.
* Customize the shapes to use in realtime.

## Usage

This demo lets you load up your own images to be converted to shapes using Primitive Haxe.

## Notes
* Got an idea or suggestion? Open an issue on GitHub, or send Sam a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sam_Twidale).
* Primitive Haxe is based on [primitive](https://github.com/fogleman/primitive), a Go library created by [Michael Fogleman](https://github.com/fogleman).
* Primitive Haxe is available as a [haxelib](https://lib.haxe.org/p/primitive-haxe).
* This demo only works with the Haxe JavaScript target.
